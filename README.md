# RescueRobot

In this project, where we focus on search and rescue robot algorithms for post-earthquake debris environments, our first goal is to integrate the mobile robot (Duckiebot) in our university’s robotics laboratory into the Gazebo simulation and initially run the algorithms in this simulated environment. The objectives of the algorithms we plan to use are as follows: human detection in low-light conditions using an IR camera, and mapping and SLAM capabilities using only camera data.

The second phase of the project is to integrate the algorithms that we successfully run in simulation into the Duckiebot. Our project is ongoing, stay tuned!
